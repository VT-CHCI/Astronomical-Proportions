# Astronomical Proportions #
Can we help middle schoolers to understand scale (as in relative scale of planets or their distances from each other, like in Science class)?

## Description ##
This application helps students understand and visualize the relationship between the scale of different objects.

# Features #
The application has three different modes, compare mode, analogy mode, and prediction mode. 

*Compare Mode
	* This mode will automatically show the difference in scale between the two objects.
*Analogy Mode
	* This mode asks the user to select 2 different objects that have a certain scale and then asks the user to select two more objects of the same scale.
*Prediction Mode
	* This mode asks the user to scale the smaller of the two objects to the correct size.

# User Guide #
	*To Run Application
	1. Select the mode and the dimension that you wish to compare. (i.e. mode: analogy, dimension: diameter)
	2. Select the two objects you wish to compare
	3. (Analogy Mode Only) Select two more objects that have the same scale as the first two.
	3. (Prediction Mode Only) Scale the objects to the correct size, hit "check me" button.
	
	*To add Object
	1. Sign in
	2. Click "add new item" on the right hand toolbar
	3. Insert information about the item in meters (i.e. 1km entered as 1000)
	4. Add Picture (Required)
	5. Click "Create Item"

## Future ##
* have the app prompt the student
	* have the app choose a relationship <<, < =, >, >> or something, and the student has to choose the two objects
	* have the app choose 2 objects, and prompt the student to choose 2 others that have the same relationship
* have interactivity between students
	* have the student 1 choose the relation and student 2 (on other pc) choose objects
	* have student 1 choose first 2 objects, and have student 2 (try to) choose 2 objects that have the same relationship.
* when students are viewing the "Data Table" (items index) enable some kind of "Question this datum" feature to have them critically examine the data
